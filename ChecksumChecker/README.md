# How-To-Use
Open terminal and verify that you are inside the ChecksumChecker folder that holds the script. If images and manifest are in a subdirectory, such as here, use  `python verify_manifest.py Sample_images`. If images and manifest are inside the same folder as the script, simply use `python verify_manifest.py`. 
Please note that the manifest and images must be in the same folder.
